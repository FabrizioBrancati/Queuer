### Shared Queuer

```swift
Queuer.shared.addOperation(operation)
```

### Custom Queue

```swift
let queue = Queuer(name: "MyCustomQueue")
```

You can even create a queue by defining the `maxConcurrentOperationCount` and the `qualityOfService` properties:
```swift
let queue = Queuer(name: "MyCustomQueue", maxConcurrentOperationCount: Int.max, qualityOfService: .default)
```

### Create an Operation Block
You have three methods to add an `Operation` block:

- Directly on the `queue`(or `Queuer.shared`):
    ```swift
    queue.addOperation {
        /// Your task here
    }
    ```

- Creating a `ConcurrentOperation` with a block:
    ```swift
    let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
        /// Your task here
    }
    queue.addOperation(concurrentOperation)
    ```

- Creating a `SynchronousOperation` with a block:
    ```swift
    let synchronousOperation = SynchronousOperation { _ in
        /// Your task here
    }
    queue.addOperation(synchronousOperation)
    ```

> We will see how `ConcurrentOperation` and `SynchronousOperation` works later.

### Chained Operations
Chained Operations are `Operation`s that add a dependency each other.<br>
They follow the given array order, for example: `[A, B, C] = A -> B -> C -> completionBlock`.
```swift
let concurrentOperationA = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
    /// Your task A here
}
let concurrentOperationB = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
    /// Your task B here
}
queue.addChainedOperations([concurrentOperationA, concurrentOperationB]) {
    /// Your completion task here
}
```

You can also add a `completionHandler` after the queue creation with:
```swift
queue.addCompletionHandler {
    /// Your completion task here
}
```

### Group Operations
Group Operations are `Operation`s that handles a group of `Operation`s with a completion handler.<br>
Allows the execution of a block of `Operation`s with a completion handler that will be called once all the operations are finished, for example: `[A -> [[B & C & D] -> completionHandler] -> E] -> completionHandler`.
It should usually be used with a [Chained Opetation](https://github.com/FabrizioBrancati/Queuer#chained-operations).
```swift
let groupOperationA = GroupOperation(
    [
        ConcurrentOperation { _ in
            /// Your task A here
        },
        ConcurrentOperation { _ in
            /// Your task B here
        }
    ]
)

let concurrentOperationC = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
    /// Your task C here
}

queue.addChainedOperations([groupOperationA, concurrentOperationC]) {
    /// Your completion task here
}
```
In this case the output will be the following one: `[[A & B -> completionHandler] -> C] -> completionHandler`.

### Queue States
- Cancel all `Operation`s in queue:
    ```swift
    queue.cancelAll()
    ```
- Pause queue:
    ```swift
    queue.pause()
    ```
    > By calling `pause()` you will not be sure that every `Operation` will be paused.<br>
    If the `Operation` is already started it will not be on pause until it's a custom `Operation` that overrides `pause()` function.

- Resume queue:
    ```swift
    queue.resume()
    ```
    > To have a complete `pause` and `resume` states you must create a custom `Operation` that overrides `pause()` and `resume()` function.

- Wait until all `Operation`s are finished:
    ```swift
    queue.waitUntilAllOperationsAreFinished()
    ```
    > This function means that the queue will blocks the current thread until all `Operation`s are finished.

### Asynchronous Operation
`ConcurrentOperation` is a class created to be subclassed.
It allows synchronous and asynchronous tasks, has a pause and resume states, can be easily added to a queue and can be created with a block.

You can create your custom `ConcurrentOperation` by subclassing it.<br>
You must override `execute()` function and call the `finish()` function inside it, when the task has finished its job to notify the queue.

For convenience it has an `init` function with a completion block:
```swift
let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
    /// Your task here
}
concurrentOperation.addToQueue(queue)
```

### Synchronous Operation
There are three methods to create synchronous tasks or even queue:
- Setting `maxConcurrentOperationCount` of the queue to `1`.<br>
  By setting that property to `1` you will be sure that only one task at time will be executed.
- Using a `Semaphore` and waiting until a task has finished its job.
- Using a `SynchronousOperation`.<br>
  It's a subclass of `ConcurrentOperation` that handles synchronous tasks.<br>
  It's not awesome as it seems to be and is always better to create an asynchronous task, but some times it may be useful.

For convenience it has an `init` function with a completion block:
```swift
let synchronousOperation = SynchronousOperation { _ in
  /// Your task here
}
synchronousOperation.addToQueue(queue)
```

### Automatically Retry an Operation
An `Operation` is passed to every closure, with it you can set and handle the retry feature.<br>
By default the retry feature is disabled, to enable it simply set the `success` property to `false`. With `success` to `false` the `Operation` will retry until reaches `maximumRetries` property value. To let the `Operation` know when everything is ok, you must set `success` to `true`.<br>
With `currentAttempt` you can know at which attempt the `Operation` is.
```swift
let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation { operation in
    /// Your task here
    if /* Successful */ {
      operation.success = true
    } else {
      operation.success = false
    }
}
```

### Manually Retry an Operation
You can manually retry an `Operation` when you think that the execution will be successful.<br>
An `Operation` is passed to every closure, with it you can set and handle the retry feature.<br>
By default the manual retry feature is disabled, to enable it simply set the `manualRetry` property to `true`, you must do this outside of the execution closure. You must also set `success` to `true` or `false` to let the `Operation` know when is everything ok, like the automatic retry feature.<br>
To let the `Operation` retry your execution closure, you have to call the `retry()` function. If the `retry()` is not called, you may block the entire queue. Be sure to call it at least `maximumRetries` times, it is not a problem if you call `retry()` more times than is needed, your execution closure will not be executed more times than the `maximumRetries` value.
```swift
let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation { operation in
    /// Your task here
    if /* Successful */ {
      operation.success = true
    } else {
      operation.success = false
    }
}
concurrentOperation.manualRetry = true
/// Later on your code
concurrentOperation.retry()
```

### Scheduler
A `Scheduler` is a struct that uses the GDC's `DispatchSourceTimer` to create a timer that can execute functions with a specified interval and quality of service.

```swift
let schedule = Scheduler(deadline: .now(), repeating: .seconds(1)) {
    /// Your task here
}
```

You can even create a `Scheduler` without the handler and set it later:
```swift
var schedule = Scheduler(deadline: .now(), repeating: .seconds(1))
schedule.setHandler {
    /// Your task here.
}
```

With `timer` property you can access to all `DispatchSourceTimer` properties and functions, like `cancel()`:
```swift
schedule.timer.cancel()
```

### Semaphore
A `Semaphore` is a struct that uses the GCD's `DispatchSemaphore` to create a semaphore on the function and wait until it finish its job.<br>
I recommend you to use a `defer { semaphore.continue() }` right after the `Semaphore` creation and `wait()` call.

```swift
let semaphore = Semaphore()
semaphore.wait()
defer { semaphore.continue() }
/// Your task here
```

You can even set a custom timeout, default is `.distantFuture`:
```swift
semaphore.wait(DispatchTime(uptimeNanoseconds: 1_000_000_000))
```

It's more useful if used inside an asynchronous task:
```swift
let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation {
    /// Your task here
    semaphore.continue()
}
concurrentOperation.addToQueue(queue)
semaphore.wait()
```

### Queue State Restoration (Beta)
To enable the Queue Restoration feature you must use `ConcurrentOperation` with a unique (non-nil) `name` property.
Currently this feature allows you to save the current state (`OperationState`s) of your queue, like: `name`, `progress` and `dependencies`.<br>
The `progress` property allows to save the current state of the `Operation` progress. Update it constantly during the `Operation` execution.<br>
Call `Queuer.state(of: OperationQueue)` or `operationQueue.state()` to get the `QueueStateList` aka: Array of `OperationState`s.<br>
It's up to you save and retrieve this list, and create the queue correctly.

### 1 Nov 2018
### Added
- Added support to Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2
- Added retry feature to `ConcurrentOperation` class [#10](https://github.com/FabrizioBrancati/Queuer/issues/10), more info on how to use it [here](https://github.com/FabrizioBrancati/Queuer#automatically-retry-an-operation) and [here](https://github.com/FabrizioBrancati/Queuer#manually-retry-an-operation)

- Changed `executionBlock` of `ConcurrentOperation` to pass the `concurrentOperation` variable inside the closure to be able to use the retry feature. If you don't need it simply put `_ in` after the block creation:

  let concurrentOperation = ConcurrentOperation { _ in
      /// Your task here
  }
  ```
  This also affects `SynchronousOperation`
